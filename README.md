# Eneroth Edges to Cut Marks

Replace selected edges with short stumps marking their ends.
Can be used as cut marks or fold marks after printing.

This can also be used in a laser cutting workflow to move positional markers out
of the piece you engrave/cut and onto the surrounding material.
Then it can be used as a reference to draw a thin marker with pencil, that can
easily be erased when you don't need it anymore.
